This is my space to make Minecraft look nicer in more advanced ways than simply changing a texture

I'll take suggestions but inevitably what makes it in all depends on my own tastes
(and the performance of my stupid integrated graphics)
(and my own ability to code things in glsl, which I do not have much faith in)

I will not be making this pack super realistic, if you want that please kindly go elsewhere, this is a vanilla+ tweak just like the rest of my stuff

I just want block game to look pretty without losing the spirit of block game <2
